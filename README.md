KEVM: Semantics of EVM in K
===========================

[ ![Codeship Status for kframework/evm-semantics](https://app.codeship.com/projects/d3ce9a40-343d-0135-d1d4-02553a1f9242/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/226792)

In this repository we provide a model of the EVM in K.

-   [ethereum.md](ethereum.md): Driver for semantics of EVM (for loading tests, running simulations).
-   [analysis.md](analysis.md): Analysis tools for the EVM defined on top of the semantics.
-   [evm.md](evm.md): Top level EVM semantics file (including local execution and network dynamics).
-   [data.md](data.md): Specifies the basic data of EVM execution, including the 256 bit words and some datastructures over them.
-   [proofs/README.md](proofs/README.md): Specifies proofs we have performed on ERC20 tokens.
-   [issues.md](issues.md): Some comments about things which could be different about EVM.

We are continuously testing our implementation against the [Ethereum Test Set](https://github.com/ethereum/tests).
The above marker only checks for a subset of the tests (those in [our codeship list](tests/passing.expected)), though many more of the tests than those listed there are passing.

See [our technical report on KEVM 1.0](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/97207) for more detailed information and explanation.

Building and Running
--------------------

There are two versions of K available, [RV-K](https://github.com/runtimeverification/k) and [UIUC-K](https://github.com/kframework/k).
The files in `.build/uiuck/*.k` in this repository work with UIUC-K, so install that first.

The script `Build` supplied in this repository will build and run the definition (use `./Build help` to see usage information).

-   To `kompile` the definition, run `./Build`.
-   To run the tests, do `./Build test` (`./Build par-test` to run them in parallel using [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)).
-   To run a single test, do `./Build test <regx-for-test>`, for example `./Build test vmArithmeticTest/add0`.

To run in a different mode (eg. in `GASANALYZE` mode), do `export cMODE=<OTHER_MODE>` before calling `./Build`.
To run with a different fee schedule (eg. `HOMESTEAD` instead of `DEFAULT`), do `export cSCHEDULE=<OTHER_SCHEDULE>` before calling `./Build`.

### Network vs. EVM

Ethereum state consists of two parts, the network state and the EVM execution state.
Right now the semantics declares the configuration for both of these components together, and many rules reach between these two subconfigurations.
Separating the two subconfigurations and declaring an API for the network dynamics would provide a better understanding of the "necessary ingredients" for a consensus-driven distributed store.
This would also allow us to experiment with alternative programming languages to EVM for future blockchain systems.

### Full Transaction Execution

Right now we are passing the VMTests, but haven't run tests on entire transactions.
To have confidence in our semantics, we need to run the tests involving entire transactions (not just chunks of VM code).
Eventually, we should run the GeneralStateTests instead.

### TODOs

More local problems are defined with a small *TODO* next to them in the semantics.
