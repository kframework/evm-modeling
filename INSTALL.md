Installing Release Builds
=========================

Release builds exsit for older versions of KEVM (which installs the executable needed for `kevm-ganache-cli`).
This mode of interacting with KEVM is *deprecated*, but if you need it, visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics/releases).
