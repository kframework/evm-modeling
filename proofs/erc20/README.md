Formal Verification of ERC20 Smart Contracts
============================================

We present full functional correctness verification of ERC20 token contracts.
First, we formalize the high-level business logic, called [ERC20-K], based on the [ERC20 standard] document, to provide a precise and comprehensive specification of the desired functional correctness properties.
Then, we refine the specification down to EVM level to capture EVM-specific behaviors, ensuring nothing unexpected happens in the actual execution.
Custom abstractions and lemmas are provided to the K proof engine in the common [verification] lemma file.
Multiple implementations of ERC20 tokens are verified here as examples for future users who wish to verify their own contracts.
For more information, see the [Technical Report] on ERC20 verification using KEVM.

Checking Proofs
---------------

To reproduce the verification results for all of the ERC20 token contracts, simply run the following command in the root directory of this repository:

```sh
make proof-test
```

The above command will automatically build and install the KEVM semantics and the K reachability logic prover if they haven't been, which requires some dependencies installed.

Proof Structure
---------------

The file <tmpl.k> provides the main specification template which is filled in with details from each individual token/function to be verified.
Each of the individual token specifications are broken into two files, at `TOKEN/pgm-TOKEN.ini` and `TOKEN/spec-TOKEN.ini` (eg. `viper/pgm-TOKEN.ini` and `viper/spec-TOKEN.ini`).
This makes it easier to see the differences between the different ERC20 implementations here.

The verification process is broken into several steps (for a given `TOKEN`).

1.  The `TOKEN/pgm-TOKEN.ini` is read to populate the values `{COMPILER}`, `{_BALANCES}`, etc... in the file `TOKEN/spec-TOKEN.ini`.
    If a variables in `*.ini` is called `variable_name`, it is used to populate the `{VARIABLE_NAME}` value in the target file.

2.  Similarly, the resulting fields are read from `TOKEN/spec-TOKEN.ini` and substituted into the file `tmpl.k`, to generate the final specification file.

3.  The K prover is invoked on the resulting file using `./kevm prove path/to/final/filename-spec.k`.

Currently Verified ERC20 Token Contracts
----------------------------------------

We tried to verify the following ERC20 token contract implementations against [ERC20-K] and its refinement [ERC20-EVM], and found deviations as follows:

-   [Viper ERC20 token](https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/blob/master/examples/tokens/ERC20_solidity_compatible/ERC20.v.py): fully *conforming* to the ERC20 standard
-   [OpenZeppelin ERC20 token](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol): *conforming* to the standard, but:
    -   Rejecting transfers to address `0`
-   [ConsenSys ERC20 token](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/contracts/eip20/EIP20.sol): *conforming* to the standard, but:
    -   No arithmetic overflow protection
    -   Supporting infinite allowances variant
-   [HackerGold (HKG) ERC20 token](https://github.com/ether-camp/virtual-accelerator/blob/master/contracts/StandardToken.sol): *deviating* from the standard:
    -   No arithmetic overflow protection
    -   No `totalSupply` function
    -   Rejecting transfers of `0` values
    -   Returning `false` in failure
-   An ERC20 token of a personal hobby, called [KidsEducationToken](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/3301): *buggy* implementation:
    -   Typographical bug: `<=` instead of `>=`
    -   Incorrect overflow detection for self-transfers
    -   Rejecting transfers of `0` values
    -   Returning `false` in failure
